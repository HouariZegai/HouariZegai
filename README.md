I'm 23 years old, a Software Engineer from Algeria.
As an active member of the Google Developer Group (GDG) and Developer student clubs (supported by Google), I gives talks and presentations with my team and others in events and workshops.  
I have a large experience in Java. I'm also worked with Spring Boot, Angular and more.  
I am always interesting about learning and develop myself, and it made me a lifelong learner.  
I'm enjoy helping other developers by answer their questions and be an influencer by writing about programming and computer science in general in my social media pages, and also make a Youtube tutorials.
